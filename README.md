# CS442 Mobile Applications Development

Students will learn a variety of software engineering techniques and design patterns to assist in the rapid development and prototyping of applications, leveraging frameworks and APIs provided by current mobile development platforms (such as Android and iOS). Application lifecycles, data management and persistence mechanisms, and user interface design, among other topics, will be covered. Industry speakers will be invited to speak about best practices. Students (individually or in teams) will take ideas from concept to final implementation and will present their work at the end of the semester. When appropriate, students may take the additional step of deploying their work on the appropriate application marketplace(s).

# Overview
Students will learn a variety of software engineering techniques and design patterns to assist in the rapid development and prototyping of mobile software applications, leveraging frameworks and APIs provided by the Flutter toolkit. Application lifecycles, data management and persistence mechanisms, and user interface design, among other topics, will be covered.

# Class Outcomes

1. Upon completion of the course, students should be able to:
2. develop applications targeting multiple platforms using Flutter, making use of a substantial portion of its libraries and APIs
3. discuss the decisions and tradeoffs inherent in the design and architecture of an application development framework such as Flutter
4. identify and explain common design patterns for separating and managing user interface elements, interactivity, dynamic data, persistence, and concurrency, among other software application concerns
5. take a mobile development project from concept/mockup to final implementation
